# Flask-based Facial Recognition Access Control Backend Management System

## Overview

This project is a backend management system for facial recognition-based access control, built using the Flask web framework and OpenCV library. It provides secure access management by recognizing authorized users through facial recognition technology.

## Features

- Facial recognition authentication for access control
- Easy setup and deployment
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**  
  python -m venv venvâ€¨source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
  cd /path/to/project-directory
3. **Install project dependencies**  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Flask application**
  python app.py

## Usage

Once the server is running, the backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (default).
